# My portfolio

I followed Ania Kubows tutorial and created a new portfolio for myself. 
I don't got any logo so I added a picture of Miley Cyrus instead cause she is the Queen. 

The background photo is taken by my crappy iphone 7 camera so sorry for the pixels, <br> but the picture is of the Atlantic Ocean
so I will keep it until I take another one!
